sim_1 : simple concept simulation. chromothripsis model executed with fake gene sequence. model steps include:
	- number of breakpoints
	- generation of breakpoint indices
	- sequence fragmentation
	- fragment shuffling
	- fragment inversion
	- fragment deletion
	- fragment recombination into new sequence

sim_2 : application of model specific to chromosome 22.
	- number of breakpoints now based on distribution observed in Cortés-Ciriano (2020).
